Command-line heat map for binary files.

*birno* visually renders raw bytes for
fun and absolutely no profit.

## Features

- Command-line tool
- Read binary input into *stdin*
- Maximum colors. *birno* Uses 24-bit
  truecolor support in modern terminals.
- Multiple, perceptually uniform color
  schemes to choose from

That's it! See [As Compared to
X](#as-compared-to-x) for more featureful
alternatives and [Roadmap](#roadmap) for
where *birno* is heading.


## Installation

Pre-built packages are not available yet.

First install the requisites:

* Clang 16

Then, build from source:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/sullvn/birno.git
$ cd birno
$ make
```


## As Compared to X

*birno*'s real purpose is as a tiny
project to refresh myself with modern
C++23. So you will probably be better
served by one of these:

- [**binvis.io**][0] is a binary visualizer
  web app. Retains visual locality and has
  some neat semantic coloring options.
  In contrast, *birno* has almost no
  features and is a terminal program.
- [**binocle**][1] is a tweakable desktop
  GUI. *birno* has the same perceptually 
  uniform color schemes.
- [**veles**][2] is very featureful binary
  analysis and visualization desktop GUI.
  Can do 3-dimensional visualization.
  *birno* just does 1,2-dimensional
  visualisation.


## Roadmap

1. Publish pre-built binaries and packages
2. Maybe port to Rust?
